jsPaint
=======

Simple JS paint app - just for JS learning and training

This js app is/will be the result of an collaborative effort,
done by some people, gathering with the purpose of lerning
and training programming - using JS.

So please be aware that some things here might not be done
in the perfect way - its just work and improvement in progress!
